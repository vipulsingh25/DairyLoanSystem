# Dairy Loan System

The primary objective of this project is to develop an integrated microfinance platform that caters to the unique needs of farmers, pooling agents, and financial institutions. Specific objectives include:

    1. Streamlining the loan application and approval process.
    2. Enhancing financial transparency and data accessibility.
    3. Promoting financial inclusion in rural areas.
    4. Empowering financial institutions with insights for informed decision-making.
Project encompasses the creation of four distinct portals: the **Farmer Portal**, **Pooling Agent Portal**, **Admin Portal**, and **Bank Admin Portal**. These portals are designed to facilitate efficient communication, data sharing, and financial transactions among stakeholders.
